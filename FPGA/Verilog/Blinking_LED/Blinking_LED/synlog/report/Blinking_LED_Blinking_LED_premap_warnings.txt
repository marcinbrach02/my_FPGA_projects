@W: MT529 :"e:\git\my_projects\blinking_led\blinking_led.v":14:1:14:6|Found inferred clock Blinking_LED|CLK50 which controls 27 sequential elements including counter[26:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
