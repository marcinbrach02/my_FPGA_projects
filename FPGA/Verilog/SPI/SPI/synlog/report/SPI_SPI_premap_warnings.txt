@W: MT529 :"e:\git\my_projects\fpga\verilog\spi\fifo4.v":69:0:69:5|Found inferred clock SPI|clk_i which controls 84 sequential elements including rfifo.gb. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
