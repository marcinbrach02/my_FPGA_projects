@W: MT529 :"e:\git\my_projects\fpga\verilog\tester_module\dev_uart_tx.v":41:0:41:5|Found inferred clock tester_module|CLOCK50 which controls 168 sequential elements including uart.tx.txack. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
